    "\n",
    "This is a jupyter notebook designed to let you get used to notebooks, and to test your python and notebooks installation.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find much information on using notebooks on the [web](https://jupyter.org/), so you might start by exploring some of that.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should do the tasks in this notebook before the first class. We need to assume at that class that you have the basic familiarity with notebooks you will gain here.\n",
    "\n",
    "##¬†Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "There are no prerequisites for this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that you can 'run' the code in a code block using the `>| Run`  widget (above) or hitting the keys ('typing') `SHIFT` and `RETURN` at the same time. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Timing\n",
    "\n",
    "The session should take around 30 minutes.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Some resources\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "We will be using notebooks to present coursenotes and view and run exercises. We will mainly be doing that using the [anaconda distribution of python](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/python) (You can refer to [previous section](/notebooks/geog0111-core/notebooks/000_Running_options.ipynb) for details). This should already be installed for you if you are viewing this, but we will runs some tests below just to make sure.\n",

Some cells, such as the one this is written in, are 'text' cells, where we format the text in a language called [markdown](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Notebook/Working%20With%20Markdown%20Cells.html)."

These are the so-called **global variables**, and we will learn about **local variables** in the future. Additionally, we have seen that if we try to access a variable before we have declared it, it will throw a `NameError`, telling us this. Having seen this type of error once, and understanding why it occurred should prepare us for the next time we see one similar.\n",
